# Introduction

PyDP is a Python wrapper for Google's [Differential Privacy](https://github.com/google/differential-privacy) project. The library provides a set of Îµ-differentially private algorithms, which can be used to produce aggregate statistics over numeric data sets containing private or sensitive information.

PyDP is part of the OpenMined community, come join the movement on [Slack](http://slack.openmined.org/).

# Instructions

If you'd like to contribute to this project please read these [guidelines](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyDP/blob/master/contributing.md).


## Usage

As part of the 0.1.1 dev release, we have added all functions required in carrots demo. These include: 
- BoundedMean
- BoundedSum
- Max
- Count Above

Along with few others: 
- Percentile
- Min
- Median

To install the package:
`pip install python-dp`

For usage, refer to [Jupyer Notebook](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyDP/blob/dev/examples/1.1%20-%20Introductions%20to%20PyDP.ipynb) or [Python file](https://github.com/OpenMined/PyDP/blob/dev/examples/carrots.py).
Sample usage can be found below.


```
import pydp as dp # imports the DP library

# To calculate the Bounded Mean
# epsilon is a number between 0 and 1 denoting privacy threshold
# It measures the acceptable loss of privacy (with 0 meaning no loss is acceptable)
# If both the lower and upper bounds are specified, 
# x = dp.BoundedMean(epsilon: double, lower: int, upper: int)
x = dp.BoundedMean(0.6, 1, 10)

# If lower and upper bounds are not specified, 
# DP library automatically calculates these bounds
# x = dp.BoundedMean(epsilon: double)
x = dp.BoundedMean(0.6)

# To get the result
# Currently supported data types are integer and float. Future versions will support additional data types
# Refer to examples/carrots.py for an introduction
x.result(input_data: list)

```

Known issue: If the privacy budget (epsilon is too less), we get a StatusOR error in the command line. While this needs to be raised as an error, right now, it's just displayed as an error in logs.
